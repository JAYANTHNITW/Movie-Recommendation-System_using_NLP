# Movie-Recommendation-System_using_NLP
### The goal is to provide 5 related movies if you enter the name of a movie.
From the dataset's 23 columns. I only included significant data, such as ['movie_id,' title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew]. The issue with some of these columns is the presence of respected row values in dictionary format. But we need the dictionary values in a list format, thus I used 'ast.literal_eval' to do this operation.Using a defined function, I have chosen the top 3 casts from the cast column.I simply selected the director's name in the crew column. I have merged all the columns into a single column called "tags" after performing some simple preprocessing on each one. I stemmed the words in the tags column using Porter Stemmer. The "Bag of words" has then been applied. I've used 'cosine_similarity' to look for movies that are similar to the one in question.
